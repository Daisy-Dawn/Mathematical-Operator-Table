# Mathematical-Operator-Table
A modified Mathematical Operator table
This program allows a user to input an operator and digit to provide a mathematical table using the operand from 0 - 20.
This program was designed/coded using the double data type, yet to find one for the int.
I was really finding it hard to create a table that allows a user to input a mathetical operator which in turn holds a digit in order to get the mathetical table as output.
But after much research, i had to come up with one using double data type, but as the data types entails, it accepts an integer input too which is also fine.
I'll keep trying in order to code using just the int data type, if there's one in c programming
